# Next-Word-Prediction-Model-using-Python


The Next Word Prediction models have a range of applications across various industries. For example, when you start typing a message on your phone, it suggests the next word to speed up your typing. Similarly, search engines predict and show search suggestions as you type in the search bar. Next word prediction helps us communicate faster and more accurately by anticipating what we might say or search for.

To build a Next Word Prediction model:

1.start by collecting a diverse dataset of text documents, 

2.preprocess the data by cleaning and tokenizing it, 

3.prepare the data by creating input-output pairs, 

4.engineer features such as word embeddings, 

5.select an appropriate model like an LSTM or GPT, 

6.train the model on the dataset while adjusting hyperparameters,

7.improve the model by experimenting with different techniques and architectures.

his iterative process allows businesses to develop accurate and efficient Next Word Prediction models that can be applied in various applications.

So the process of building a Next Word Prediction model starts by collecting textual data that can be a vocabulary for our model. For example, the way you type on your smartphone’s keyboard becomes the vocabulary of the next word prediction model of your smartphone’s keyboard. In the same way, we need textual data for our model. I found an ideal dataset for this task based on the text of a book on Sherlock Holmes.
